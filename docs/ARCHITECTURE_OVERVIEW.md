# Wtr-Lab Novel Reader App Architecture Manual
## System-Wide Topology & Architectural Blueprint

This document provides system-wide topological details, structural boundaries, and interface definitions describing the Wtr-Lab Novel Reader browser. It is written to preserve extreme documentation, allowing any standard-level LLM or AI system to perfectly reconstruct or replicate the application's entire architecture.

## 🧭 Architectural Topology & Component Interlocking

The application is structured around a decentralized yet highly coordinated model utilizing **Jetpack Compose (UI)**, a **Foreground Service (Text-To-Speech background execution)**, **Android WebView pooling**, and an **SQLite local Room Database**.

The visual map below outlines how states, interfaces, bridges, and databases interlock:

## 🔄 Concurrency, Thread Synchronization, and State Flow

State propagation acts entirely through type-safe, asynchronous reactive pipelines using Kotlin `StateFlow` coupled with Jetpack Compose lifecycle-aware collections (`collectAsStateWithLifecycle`).

### 1. The Global Audio State Bus (`WtrAudioControlBridge.kt`)
To decoupled the Compose visual rendering thread (UI thread) from the long-lived background service thread (worker thread run by Android's TextToSpeech engine scheduler), the global Singleton object `WtrAudioControlBridge` holds synchronous states and direct lambdas:
- `isPlaying: StateFlow<Boolean>` -> Controls lockscreen notification player state, visual indicators, play/pause toggles.
- `playTrackInputList: StateFlow<List<String>>` -> Holds the in-memory array of paragraph text blocks belonging to the active tracks spoken.
- `currentTrackIndex: StateFlow<Int>` -> Tracks active paragraph being read.
- `ttsSpeed: StateFlow<Float>`, `ttsPitch: StateFlow<Float>` -> Direct pitch and rate attributes bound locally across views.
- Callback closures (`playAction`, `pauseAction`, `nextAction`, `prevAction`, `nextChapterAction`, `playCustomParagraphAction`, `onCancelNative`) that target either the active Compose WebView's JS injection threads or Native TTS player routes.

### 2. Active Tab URL Synchronization & Background Hijacking Prevention
One of the most critical concurrency edge cases in Android WebView applications is prevention of **Background Tab Hijacking of the Address Bar**:
- **Defect Scenario**: A user opens target websites in multiple tabs. Tab A is active and being viewed. Tab B is in the background, but was loading. When Tab B finishes loading in the background, it triggers `onPageFinished`. If the browser simply binds of `onUrlSynced` or address updates globally, Tab B's loaded URL will hijack Tab A's address bar, causing unexpected page redirection, visual stutter, or web page freezes.
- **Topological Safeguard**: The `onUrlSynced` receiver inside `WtrWebAppInterface` is heavily guarded. It always dynamically resolves the *currently active tab* from the viewport (`viewModel.currentTab.value`) and checks if the WebView triggering the background event matches the active tab's unique ID:
  ```kotlin
  val currentActiveTab = viewModel.currentTab.value
  if (currentActiveTab != null && currentActiveTab.id == triggeringTabId) {
      // Safely apply URL address bar visual text updates!
  }
  ```

## 🔗 The JavaScript WebView Bridge Mechanics & Security

To bridge client-side Javascript scripts with Native Kotlin code, `WtrWebAppInterface` is mapped via WebView's custom injection `addJavascriptInterface`.

### 1. Injected Bridge Signatures
```javascript
window.WtrAndroidBridge = {
    postPlaybackState: function(isPlaying, novelName, chapterTitle, activeWebsite, speed, pitch) { ... },
    syncPollState: function(isPlaying, currentParagraphIndex, currentWordIndex) { ... },
    onUrlSynced: function(currentUrl) { ... }
};
```

### 2. JavaScript Bridge and Ad-Blocker/Security Interfacing (WARNING)
Many novel reading hosts (and in particular **Wtr-Lab companion servers** or companion analytics platforms) employ strict automated script-tracking loops to prevent headless browser ad-scraping and browser bots. By tracking elements such as the `window.speechSynthesis` API, mouse moves, and DOM mutations, hosts attempt to identify scrapers.
- **Automated Anti-Scraping Safeguard Warnings**: If the JavaScript bridge interactions (specifically for word tracking or WebSpeech mock integrations) are bypassed or turned off globally, host site tracking defenses detect an anomaly. They treat the browser as a hostile **"Ad-Blocker Active" scraper bot**, halting Chapter DOM rendering immediately or displaying infinite loops of `"Please stop your ad blocker to continue reading"`.
- **Architectural Binding Rule**: Native hooks must never disconnect or discard of JavaScript injections even when the player uses Native Speech fallback TTS (`playTrackInputList` parsing). State updates must echo back to the webpage DOM via `evaluateJavascript` to sync playback indicators cleanly, satisfying security challenges transparently.

## 🎧 Isolated Concurrent Tab TTS Segregation

When multiple tabs are opened with separate visual states, users expect consistent audio execution:
- **Rule of Isolation**: The audio stream belongs exclusively to the claimed tab ID (`WtrAudioControlBridge.activeTtsTabId`).
- Changing active browser viewing tabs (Tab A -> Tab B) must **never** disrupt the background playing TTS belonging to Tab A, unless the user starts a fresh TTS playback session elements inside Tab B.
- Initiating TTS inside Tab B claims tab-ownership, resetting Tab A's audio pipeline cleanly to prevent overlapping spoken audio voices from different tabs.
